2. Client form functions
3. Connect to spring/kotlin backend
4. Create admin basic styling + ui for crud on properties and managing client reqs
5. Double check db/backend

once all that ^ is done

7. Fix any ui issues
8. Use framer motion or gsap to update/animate where needed (Nav first!!)

Other on the go changes/notes:

- get consistent img sizes
- when db connects update the property gallery (currently using local info)
- Change Gallery links to their respective properties, not just a placeholder
